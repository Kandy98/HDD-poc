A Health Data Dictionary, as defined in the IBM Dictionary of Computing, is a "centralized repository of information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format."

A health data dictionary must clearly define the meaning of each data item stored in the system to ensure that terms are clearly understood and correctly used by all the systems.

HDD achieves the goal of coded vocabulary by laying the foundation in the from of following building blocks:
1.	Concept 
2.	Representations
3.	Context
4.	Relation
